In order to perform theoretical and simulational analysis of the circuit Octave and Ngspice were used, respectively.


Theoretical methods were used to compute the gain, impedances and frequency responde of both of the stages. Contrary to past lab assignments the theoretical results differ a lot from the simulated results.

Comparing the frequency response graphs we can see that they are quite different for higher frequencies. The most noticeable difference is that the theoretical method does not predict the higher cutoff frequency. This is explained by the fact that the theoretical method considers the OP-Amp as ideal when in reality all of the components have some residual capacitive characteristics which can become noticeable at really high frequencies.

In conclusion, our simulated circuit was able to acheive a decent gain and Merit value and so we considered it a sucess. In addition we were able to understand the functioning principles of a Band-Pass Filter.
