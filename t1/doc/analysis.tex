% Intro

In this section, the circuit in Figure \ref{fig:Desenho_t1} is analysed theoretically.

Two methods were used and both will be explained and presented. In Subsection \ref{subsec:mesh_met}
the aplication of the mesh method and its results are shown. In Subsection \ref{subsec:node_met} the
same is done with the node method. \\

In both of these methods, three important equations were used: both Kirchhoff's laws (Kirchhof's
current law (KCL) - eq.(\ref{eq:kcl}) and Kirchhoff's voltage law (KVL) - eq.(\ref{eq:kvl}));
Ohm's law (eq.(\ref{eq:ohm})).

The algebraic sum of all the currents in any given node is zero:
\begin{equation}
	\sum I_i = 0
	\label{eq:kcl}
\end{equation}

The algebraic sum of all the voltages in any given closed-loop circuit (mesh) is zero:
\begin{equation}
	\sum V_i = 0
	\label{eq:kvl}
\end{equation}

The potential difference between the two nodes connected to a resistor is equal to the current that 
passes through the resistor multiplied by the its resistance.
\begin{equation}
	V_i = R_iI_i
	\label{eq:ohm}
\end{equation}

\subsection{Mesh method}
\label{subsec:mesh_met}

To correclty use the mesh method, firstly, four currents must be considered, one for each simple mesh.
They were identidied as follows: $I_1$ - associated with the top left mesh; $I_2$ - associated with
the top right mesh; $I_3$ - associated with the bottom left mesh; $I_4$ - associated with the bottom
right mesh. Every one of these currents is assumed to run counter clockwise. \\

Afterwards, eq.(\ref{eq:kvl}) needs to be applied in the meshes not containing any type of current
sources (eq.(\ref{eq:kvl_m1}) and eq.(\ref{eq:kvl_m3})) . Moreover, it is essential to relate the
remaing mesh current with those created by the current sources (eq.(\ref{eq:rel_cur1}) and
eq.(\ref{eq:rel_cur2})). Likewise, eq.(\ref{eq:rel_cur3}) is also obtained.

\begin{equation}
	V_a = I_1(R_1+R_3+R_4)-I_2(R_3)-I_3(R_4)
	\label{eq:kvl_m1}
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
	-V_c = I_3(R_4+R_6+R_7)-I_1(R_4)
	\label{eq:kvl_m3}
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
	I_2 = -I_b
	\label{eq:rel_cur1}
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
	I_4 = -I_d
	\label{eq:rel_cur2}
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
	I_3 = -I_c
	\label{eq:rel_cur3}
\end{equation}

Further realtions need to be composed in order to solve the circuit. We must not forget the two equations
from the linear dependent sources (eq.(\ref{eq:depsrc1}) and eq.(\ref{eq:depsrc2})). In adition, by
making use of eq.(\ref{eq:ohm}), one more equation is acquired, eq. \ref{eq:rel_ohm1}.

\begin{equation}
	I_b = K_bV_b
	\label{eq:depsrc1}
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
	V_c = K_cI_b
	\label{eq:depsrc2}
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
	I_1(R_3)-I_2(R_3) = V_b
	\label{eq:rel_ohm1}
\end{equation}

With eight equations and eight unkown variables, the sistem can be solved.

\subsection{Node method}
\label{subsec:node_met}


Similarly to the previous subsection, for the node method, ground was considered to be where it is identified in
Figure \ref{fig:Desenho_t1}. In adition, assume $V_{Ni}$ to be the voltage in node $Ni$ (every node position can
also be found in Figure \ref{fig:Desenho_t1}). \\



The results were computed by Octave and organized in Table \ref{tab:node}
