For this laboratory assignment, we were given a circuit composed by resistors, dependent and independent current and voltage sources and had the objective of analyzing and simulating it and then compare the results obtained.

Static analyses were performed theoretically, through mesh and node analysis and by circuit simulation,
using the Octave math tool and Ngspice tool, respectively. The simulation results matched
the theoretical results very precisely. So in that order it is safe to say that our objective was achieved successfully.
