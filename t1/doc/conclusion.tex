\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

%In this laboratory assignment the objective of analysing an RC circuit has been
%achieved. Static, time and frequency analyses have been performed both
%theoretically using the Octave maths tool and by circuit simulation using the
%Ngspice tool. The simulation results matched the theoretical results
%precisely. The reason for this perfect match is the fact that this is a
%straightforward circuit containing only linear components, so the theoretical
%and simulation models cannot differ. For more complex components, the
%theoretical and simulation models could differ but this is not the case in this work.

For this laboratory assignment, we were given a circuit composed by 7 resistors, 1 
independent voltage source, 1 independent current source, 1 dependent voltage source, and 1 
dependent current source and had the objective of analyzing it, which we did successfully.
Static analyses were performed theoretically and by circuit simulation, using the Octave 
math tool and Ngspice tool, respectively. The simulation results matched the theoretical 
results very precisely, despite the circuit having dependent voltage and current sources 
(which could have caused some discrepancies in the results).
