For this laboratory assignment, we were given a circuit composed by 7 resistors, 1 
independent voltage source, 1 independent current source, 1 current-dependent voltage
source, 1 voltage-dependent current source and had the objective of analyzing and simulating
it, which we did successfully. 

Static analyses were performed theoretically and by circuit simulation,
using the Octave math tool and Ngspice tool, respectively. The simulation results matched
the theoretical results very precisely, despite the circuit having dependent voltage and
current sources (which could have caused some discrepancies in the results).
