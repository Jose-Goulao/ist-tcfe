In order to perform theoretical and simulational analysis of the circuit Octave and Ngspice were used, respectively.
To obtain the theoretical values of the diodes, both Kirchhoff Laws and the $V_{on}$ model were used. Then, in order to graphically obtain the value of $V_0$ over time, a plot was made and is shown in FIGURE 2.
Posteriorly, with the simulation of the circuit we were able to make the same plot as before obtaining approximate results.
Finally we proceeded to the optimization of the input values achieving the Merit shown before.
Therefore, the objective of the laboratory was achieved succesfuly.
